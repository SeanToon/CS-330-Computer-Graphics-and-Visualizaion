# CS-330-Computer-Graphics-and-Visualizaion

The project I worked on is a 3D scene created using OpenGL, representing my desk space at home. The Debug folder contains an executable (.exe) file that can be run to view the project, while the OpenGlSample folder includes all the program files. The main code is located in the Source.cpp file.

Throughout this project, I was provided with various resources to help me learn OpenGL. I primarily relied on LearnOpenGL.com and a GitHub repository that provided tutorials on how to implement specific features into my project. Since I had no prior experience with OpenGL, my design process involved a cycle of reading from the LearnOpenGL book, conducting research, and then applying what I learned to code my project. This experience greatly enhanced my ability to conduct effective research, retain key information, and apply it to practical coding tasks.

As I progressed with the project, I refined my development strategies. Given the complexity and size of the code I was working with, I developed a strong habit of writing and executing small chunks of code at a time. The code consisted of multiple parts, functions, and classes, making it challenging to pinpoint errors. By focusing on one section at a time and thoroughly testing it before moving forward, I minimized the risk of introducing errors and made the debugging process more manageable. Although I am still learning C++ and best coding practices, each step of the project improved my understanding of efficient code design and better programming practices.

My long-term aspiration is to enter the AI industry, and I anticipate that some of the concepts I learned in the field of Computer Graphics and Visualization will intersect with AI applications. For example, the use of matrices, vectors, the laws of physics, and an understanding of dimensions will be highly relevant in AI, especially in areas like robotics. My experience with C++ has grown significantly throughout this project. I've written more code in this course than in any previous class, which has greatly improved my familiarity with the C++ language. Additionally, I have become more adept at navigating files and resolving issues related to file management, which has enhanced my debugging skills. This project has been a crucial step in advancing my technical skills, and I look forward to applying these concepts in future endeavors, particularly in AI.
